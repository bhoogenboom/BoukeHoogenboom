# I Love to run!

Upcomming Run's being the 'Station-to-Station' run between the train station in Ommen and Dalfsen. This run is 10 EM (16,1 KM) at the 31ste of May and just mmore then a week later my first 'Half Marathon - Zwolle' on the 10th of June. So at the moment I'm training three to four times a week to expand my Aerobic Base.

### Running history

When I was enlisted with the Dutch Army I ran quite a bit as you can imagine. Also combined with all different sorts of exercises and training programs. After my adventure I kept running short distances between 5K and 12K.
