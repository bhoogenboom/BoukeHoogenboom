# Hi, welcome to my blog!
{: style="text-align: center;"}

I'm Bouke Hoogenboom and would describe myself as a driven and athletic Azure Specialist who enjoys informing people about the Cloud landscape. By combining my technical knowledge with a practical perspective and determination, I aim to help people and organizations understand the Cloud.

My motto **“Run. Lift. Code”** reflects my passion for running, fitness, and you can also regularly find me on the basketball court. For me the word **Code** represents coding in the broadest sense, from working with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in the Cloud to home automation projects or working with AI.
