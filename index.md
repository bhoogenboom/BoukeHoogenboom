# Hi, welcome to my blog!

I'm Bouke Hoogenboom and would describe myself as a driven and athletic Azure Specialist who enjoys informing people about the Cloud landscape. 
By combining my technical knowledge with a practical perspective and determination, I aim to help people and organizations understand the Cloud. 

My motto **“Run. Lift. Code”** reflects my passion for running, fitness, and you can also regularly find me on the basketball court.
For me the word **Code** represents coding in the broadest sense, from working with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in the Cloud to home automation projects or working with AI.

I'd like to share my experiences and insights on this blog, hoping to inspire and assist others on their own journeys.

**Have fun!**
